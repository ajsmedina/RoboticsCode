# RoboticsCode

An assortment of python code used to run the Lego NXT robot during competitions.

# The Robotics Team

The Robotics Team of Notre Dame Catholic Secondary School consisted of me and two others who were interested in robotics.
We designed, built, programmed, and tested Lego NXT robots using Python and the Lego NXTed software.

As the lead programmer, I was in charge of making sure our program ran smoothly to create an automated robot that met the competition specifications.

# New Challenges

By working in a team, we were able to create robots that could overcome various tasks such as fight other robots in UOIT's
annual "Sumobot" competition or other school baord events such as the "Control Zone" event where the robot must locate
and park on a specific square on the board.

# Competition Reports

The robots also required robotics reports that outline the specifications and design choices of the robots we used. I was in charge
of gathering this information and writing these reports for the team.
